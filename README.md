<h2>What is PyPackage?</h2>

PyPackage is a package manager which works a little bit differently - it can be run by normal users and manages software which comes in archives (think the `.tar.gz` download of Firefox, Discord, etc).

<h2>How is PyPackage made?</h2>

PyPackage is written in Python, tested with Python version 3.7.8.
It requires the PyPI package <code>urlgrabber</code>, which can be obtained with the command <code>pip3.7 install urlgrabber</code>

<h2>Why was PyPackage made?</h2>

PyPackage was written originally for use by myself, but a friend of mine said it should be easier to access, saving it from the `hax` directory on my profile.

I made PyPackage because I was annoyed that I had to open a browser, go to the program's website, download the files, extract, delete the old files, move the extracted files to the location of the old files, all manually - it got really annoying and repetitive, so I made PyPackage.

<h2>Why doesn't PyPackage do <code>$THING</code>?</h2>

PyPackage is in very early stages of development, and a lot of features are planned, but missing (like zipfile extraction, removal of software and easy addition to the repos of software).

<h2>How can I help with PyPackage?</h2>

In any way you want! Report bugs, create pull requests, even just starring it helps!
I am not accepting any donations at this time, though.
